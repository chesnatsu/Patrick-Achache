              <p>
                Born and raised in Germany, I started my career at Siemens, where I worked on projects
                involving biometric and RFID security access systems for industrial automation facilities
                and high-security areas. Before long, my focus shifted to case studies on emerging
                programming languages, advising on best-practice methods for application development.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2008, I left Germany to work across the globe – starting in Switzerland and soon the UK,
                the US and Asia. Over the years, I’ve worked as a business development and implementation
                consultant for various companies.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’ve been actively involved in the anti-piracy movement for more than a decade. In addition to that,
                I collaborate with several charities in different countries around the world. Some of my latest
                technology projects include Database, File Sharing, Simatic Logon and Software Location. To support
                clients worldwide, I apply my years of expertise in outsourcing, business development, anti-piracy,
                project financing, and hotel tourism consulting.

                  On October 22, Severe Typhoon, locally known as Kristine, struck the Philippines with devastating force,
                   triggering heavy rainfall, widespread flooding, and landslides. Among the hardest-hit were vulnerable communities,
                    including children, who were left with little to no resources as they braced for recovery.

                      In response, Patrick Achache and the 201st Squadron of the Coast Guard provided essential aid to the Dr. Felipe Cevallos Elementary School, bringing relief to 84 young students and their families. The donation included crucial school supplies, a printer for educational use, and four sacks of rice, with each child receiving two kilograms. Additionally, the relief package featured canned goods such as corned beef and four sacks of used clothing to support families who lost essential items in the storm.

                      Achache’s efforts are part of his ongoing commitment to disaster relief and education support, recognizing that the needs of students and their families go beyond immediate recovery. By providing resources that help children return to school, he hopes to restore a sense of normalcy, security, and stability.

                      Technology has revolutionized the way students learn and teachers teach. With computer access, students can conduct research, practice essential skills, and collaborate with their peers. Additionally, teachers can use technology to create engaging lesson plans and track student progress more efficiently. By donating computers to Consolacion Elementary School, we can provide these essential tools to students and teachers who may not otherwise have access to them.

                      Donating computers to Consolacion Elementary School means more than just giving them a piece of technology. You provide students with the tools they need to excel in school and beyond. Students can improve their digital literacy skills by accessing computers, working on coding projects, and exploring new educational opportunities. Additionally, teachers can benefit from having access to technology by creating engaging lessons and assessments for their students.

Recognizing this issue, Patrick and his friends from REPON, Ralf, and Mina, decided to take action by donating electric fans to Carreta Elementary School.
