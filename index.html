          <p>
            Born and raised in Germany, I started my career at Siemens, where I worked on projects
            involving biometric and RFID security access systems for industrial automation facilities
            and high-security areas. Before long, my focus shifted to case studies on emerging
            programming languages, advising on best-practice methods for application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2008, I left Germany to work across the globe – starting in Switzerland and soon the UK,
            the US and Asia. Over the years, I’ve worked as a business development and implementation
            consultant for various companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve been actively involved in the anti-piracy movement for more than a decade. In addition to that,
            I collaborate with several charities in different countries around the world. Some of my latest
            technology projects include Database, File Sharing, Simatic Logon and Software Location. To support
            clients worldwide, I apply my years of expertise in outsourcing, business development, anti-piracy,
            project financing, and hotel tourism consulting.

              Extending a Hand: Relief Mission to Earthquake-Affected Communities in Cebu

            <p class="paragraph">
              On the heels of the recent devastating earthquake that struck Cebu and surrounding areas, I had the
              opportunity to be part of a heartfelt mission — delivering much-needed relief goods to communities whose
              lives were suddenly shaken, both literally and figuratively. It was a humbling experience that reminded me
              of the power of compassion, solidarity, and community.

                <h3>Reaching Out Where It Matters Most</h3>
                <p>Disasters hit the vulnerable hardest. We quickly mobilized resources and coordinated with local
                  partners. Our goal was to get relief to those in greatest need, efficiently and swiftly.
                  Our team visited several hard-hit municipalities, bringing essential supplies such as food, clean
                  water, hygiene kits, and basic necessities to support the local communities. Here’s a quick overview
                  of the areas we reached: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Borbon, Cebu</b> – We gave relief goods to 150 families deeply affected by the quake. Many had
                    damaged homes and struggled to access essentials. </li>
                  <li><b>Daanbantayan, Cebu</b> – We distributed aid to 20 families, and the deep gratitude shown by the
                    recipients was a moving testament to their resilience. </li>
                  <li><b>Compostela, Cebu</b> – We distributed relief to 10 families. Each had their own story of
                    resilience and recovery. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each location presented its own challenges, but also its own moments of inspiration. From the
                  tireless local volunteers to the smiles of children despite the harsh conditions, the spirit of these
                  communities was unbreakable. </p>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                <h3>More Than Just Relief </h3>
                <p>Delivering goods was just one part of our mission. We aimed to demonstrate the presence and
                  solidarity these communities deserve, making sure they knew we stood with them during this difficult
                  time.
                  We believe that small acts of kindness can bring healing. The road to recovery is long, but we are
                  committed to standing with these communities and offering ongoing support. </p>

                  donation included crucial school supplies, a printer for educational use, and four sacks of rice, with
                  each child receiving two kilograms. Additionally, the relief package featured canned goods such as
                  corned beef and four sacks of used clothing to support families who lost essential items in the storm.

                  In the beseech of help, the organization always lends out a resilient helping hand and initiates a
                  drive to donate goods, clothing, and financial aid.Even with little to no start, there sparks humility
                  and charity. The culture we have is what binds our foundation, this not only tests the care we have
                  for the employees but also proves that in dire situations there is always a silver lining.

                  Nine people have died, and hundreds have fallen ill with diarrhea in areas wrecked by Typhoon Odette
                  (international name: Rai) last month, with aid officials warning of a health crisis as millions
                  struggle to secure clean water and food. Three weeks after Odette struck southern and central islands,
                  destroying thousands of homes and killing more than 400 people, relief work continues to deliver
                  supplies to stranded residents left homeless by the storm. Patrick in cooperation with JCI and another
                  local amazing organization acted quickly and sent 30 water filter systems and canned goods to the
                  families in Siargao.

                  Initial reports showed devastation across many areas of the impacted regions, but it is only over the
                  subsequent weeks that the full scale of damage has come to light. The initial assessments only hinted
                  at the scale of destruction – nearly 1.7 million houses damaged or destroyed, massive damage to
                  infrastructure, agricultural land, fishing communities and livelihoods across a vast geographic area
                  of the country. In total, the Typhoon severely affected an estimated 9.9 million people across the six
                  worst hit regions, leaving about 2.4 million people in need of assistance. More than a month on,
                  nearly 144,000 people remain displaced, and many more are living in damaged shelters with little

              money for her treatment since her family could not afford it. I sponsored her chemotherapy to give her a

                  Educators in any part of the world help mould the efficacy of an individual. In the long run, their
                  successes affect their country’s future. The Philippines is currently financially unstable and that
                  will have an impact in the different sectors particularly education. Sometimes certain purchases are
                  pushed back to cater to higher priorities such as books, etc. This week, we donated 6 of our metal
                  office tables to Cebu City Don Carlos A Gothong National Memorial School.

                <p class="paragraph">
                  I feel that contributing to one of the tools that shape a community’s future is one of the best ways
                  to invest. Thinking about the future, I believe that education is a sure investment since education
                  plays a big role in the success of a person as well as the entire country in the long run. We support
                  education and we hope our contribution could bring something to the table. I respect educators in what
                  they do and it’s good to help them in any way.

            <p class="paragraph">
              Sometimes a cause resonates so deeply, you must speak out. For me, that cause is sickle cell disease. I am
              proud to support Het Sikkelcelfonds, a Dutch foundation dedicated to addressing this genetic condition.

                <p class="paragraph">
                <h3>What Is Sickle Cell Disease?</h3>
                <p class="paragraph"> Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder that causes red blood cells to become
                  rigid and sickle-shaped. These cells can block blood vessels, reduce oxygen flow, and break down
                  prematurely, resulting in pain, organ damage, chronic fatigue, and sometimes early death.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                  Despite its significant impact, SCD receives limited attention in public health, especially in Europe.
                  Each year, approximately
                  <b>300,000 children are born with the disease worldwide,</b> and many do not survive past childhood
                  due to inadequate care.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  SCD is both a health and social justice issue that requires greater attention.
                </p>

                <h3>Why I Support Het Sikkelcelfonds</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
