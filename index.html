              <p>
                Born and raised in Germany, I started my career at Siemens, where I worked on projects
                involving biometric and RFID security access systems for industrial automation facilities
                and high-security areas. Before long, my focus shifted to case studies on emerging
                programming languages, advising on best-practice methods for application development.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2008, I left Germany to work across the globe – starting in Switzerland and soon the UK,
                the US and Asia. Over the years, I’ve worked as a business development and implementation
                consultant for various companies.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’ve been actively involved in the anti-piracy movement for more than a decade. In addition to that,
                I collaborate with several charities in different countries around the world. Some of my latest
                technology projects include Database, File Sharing, Simatic Logon and Software Location. To support
                clients worldwide, I apply my years of expertise in outsourcing, business development, anti-piracy,
                project financing, and hotel tourism consulting.

              On October 22, Severe Typhoon, locally known as Kristine, struck the
              Philippines with devastating force, triggering heavy rainfall, widespread
              flooding, and landslides. Among the hardest-hit were vulnerable communities,
              including children, who were left with little to no resources as they braced
              for recovery.

                  In response, Patrick Achache and the 201st Squadron of the Coast Guard
                  provided essential aid to the Dr. Felipe Cevallos Elementary School,
                  bringing relief to 84 young students and their families. The donation
                  included crucial school supplies, a printer for educational use, and
                  four sacks of rice, with each child receiving two kilograms. Additionally,
                  the relief package featured canned goods such as corned beef and four
                  sacks of used clothing to support families who lost essential items
                  in the storm.

                  Achache's efforts are part of his ongoing commitment to disaster relief

                  families go beyond immediate recovery. By providing resources that help
                  children return to school, he hopes to restore a sense of normalcy,
